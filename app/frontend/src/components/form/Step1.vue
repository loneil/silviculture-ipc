          <p>Based on the guidance document, copmplete a silviculture camp risk assessment.</p>
          <p>Complete a COVID-19 risk assessment silviculture or planting operation. This is mandatory.</p>

          <p>
            Assessing each section in the
            <em>Guidelines for Silviculture Worker Camps during the COVID-19 Pandemic</em> will help you identify areas that do not sufficiently prevent or reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
          </p>
          <p>For example, if workers need to be transported to the work site in vehicles where a 2m distance cannot be maintained, this should be identified as a risk. Silviculture and Planting operators can take practical actions to reduce the risk of disease transmission (see section 7).</p>
          <p>Have you worked through all the sections in Guidelines for Silviculture Worker Camps during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify the risks at your farm?</p>

            Infection Prevention and Control Plan. By following the guidance in
            <em>Guidelines for Silviculture Worker Camps during the COVID-19 pandemic</em>, you will be developing an Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) Plan.
          </p>
          <p>For each section of the guide you identified a risk, the risk needs to be controlled. For example, if your workers ride together in a vehicle to the work site, and you follow the instructions to increase cleaning and hygiene, and increase physical distancing, this will form your IPC plan for transportation (see section 7).</p>
          <p>
            Have you decided what guidance in
            <em>Guidelines for Silviculture Worker Camps during the COVID-19 pandemic</em> is needed on your farm to prevent or control the risk of the transmission of COVID-19?
